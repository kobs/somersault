Somersault is a tiny functional programming language inspired by RPAL and
modern programming languages (think Python, Ruby, or Haskell). It's not
intended to appeal to anyone other than myself; it's more like a sandbox
for my experiments.

                         ---

The virtual machine is based on the CSE (Control, Stack, Environment) machine,
which oddly has very literature written about it. Suggestions for alternatives
are welcome.

A Somersault program consists of a single expression. There are no statements 
in Somersault.

Available primitives include booleans, integers, and (immutable) strings.

The basic collection type is a heterogenous tuple.
